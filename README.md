# Snake Game

A classic implementation of the popular Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics module. Control the snake, eat food, and avoid collisions to achieve a high score.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
2. The snake will move continuously in the direction it is facing.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food represented by a blue circle.
4. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
5. Be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body.
6. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.
7. Aim for a high score and enjoy the game!
